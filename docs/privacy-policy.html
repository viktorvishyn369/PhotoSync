        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <div class="meta">Last Updated: January 1, 2025</div>

        <p><strong>StealthLynk LLC</strong> ("Company," "we," "us," or "our") operates the PhotoLynk application (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our Service.</p>

        <h2>1. Service Overview</h2>
        <p>PhotoLynk is a photo and video backup application that operates in three distinct modes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Local Mode</strong>: Your data is stored on a server you own and operate on your local network.</li>
          <li><strong>Remote Mode</strong>: Your data is stored on a server you own and operate, accessible over the internet.</li>
          <li><strong>StealthCloud Mode</strong>: Your data is encrypted on your device before upload and stored on StealthLynk-operated infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Local and Remote Modes</h3>
        <p>When using Local or Remote modes, <strong>all data remains on servers you own and control</strong>. StealthLynk LLC does not have access to, collect, or store your photos, videos, email address, password, device identifiers, or any file metadata.</p>
        <p><strong>You are solely responsible</strong> for the security, maintenance, and backup of your self-hosted server and all data stored thereon.</p>

        <h3>2.2 StealthCloud Mode</h3>
        <p>When using StealthCloud mode, we collect and process:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Account Information</strong>: Email address for authentication purposes</li>
          <li><strong>Device Identifiers</strong>: Hardware device identifiers for security and account recovery</li>
          <li><strong>Encrypted Data</strong>: Photos and videos encrypted on your device before transmission</li>
          <li><strong>Subscription Information</strong>: Payment and subscription status (processed by third-party payment processors)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important</strong>: All media files and metadata are encrypted on your device using industry-standard encryption (XSalsa20-Poly1305) before transmission. StealthLynk LLC stores only encrypted data and <strong>does not possess the decryption keys</strong>. We cannot access, view, or decrypt your files.</p>

        <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Camera</strong>: Used only to scan QR codes for server pairing / local setup.</li>
          <li><strong>Photos/Videos</strong>: Used to back up your media, restore it, and scan for duplicates.</li>
          <li><strong>Network</strong>: Used to connect to your local server, remote server, or StealthCloud.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Encryption and Security</h2>
        <p>StealthCloud implements end-to-end encryption:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Files are encrypted on your device before upload using TweetNaCl secretbox (XSalsa20-Poly1305)</li>
          <li>Each file is split into encrypted chunks</li>
          <li>Encryption keys are derived from your credentials and stored only on your device</li>
          <li>StealthLynk LLC cannot decrypt your data</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>However</strong>, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>4.1 Data Integrity</h2>
        <p>PhotoLynk does not modify, alter, or change any metadata (EXIF data, creation date, location information, camera settings, etc.) of your photos or videos. Your files are stored exactly as they exist on your device, preserving all original properties and metadata intact.</p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Subscription payments are processed by third-party payment processors (Apple App Store, Google Play Store). We use RevenueCat for subscription management. We do <strong>not</strong> use third-party analytics, advertising networks, or tracking services.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>For Local and Remote modes, data retention is entirely under your control. For StealthCloud mode, encrypted data is retained while your subscription is active, plus a grace period after expiration. Upon account deletion, all associated encrypted data will be permanently deleted within 30 days.</p>
