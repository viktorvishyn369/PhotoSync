          <li><strong>Never share your account credentials</strong> (email and password) with any other person</li>

          <li><strong>Use strong, unique passwords</strong> that are not used for other services</li>
          <li><strong>Enable device-level security</strong> such as passcodes, biometric authentication, or encryption on your mobile device</li>

        <h3>6.2 Android Password Reset Limitations</h3>
        <div class="warning">
          <p><strong>ANDROID USERS:</strong> Password reset capability may be lost after major OS upgrades or factory resets.</p>
        </div>
        <p>On Android devices, password reset functionality is tied to a device-specific identifier. By using the Service on Android, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>

          <li>Upgrading to a major new Android OS version may reset the device identifier used for password recovery</li>
          <li>Performing a factory reset will reset the device identifier</li>

          <li>StealthLynk LLC is not liable for any data loss resulting from forgotten passwords after Android OS upgrades or factory resets</li>
          <li><strong>You are strongly advised to securely store your password before performing any Android OS upgrade or factory reset</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This limitation does not apply to iOS devices, where the device identifier persists across OS updates.</p>

        <h2>7. Clean Duplicates Feature</h2>
        <div class="warning">
          <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> The Clean Duplicates feature deletes files from your device. Use with caution.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The Clean Duplicates feature identifies and removes duplicate files based on content hash (SHA-256). By using this feature, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The feature requires your explicit confirmation before deleting any files</li>
          <li>Depending on your operating system version and configuration, deleted files may or may not be moved to the system trash/Recently Deleted folder</li>
          <li>On some OS versions, files may be permanently deleted without being moved to trash</li>
          <li>The oldest file in each duplicate group is retained; newer duplicates are deleted</li>
          <li>StealthLynk LLC is not liable for any files deleted by this feature, whether or not they are recoverable</li>
          <li>You should review duplicate groups before confirming deletion</li>
          <li>You are solely responsible for any data loss resulting from use of this feature</li>
          <li>Operating system updates may change trash/deletion behavior without notice</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Fast Mode increases CPU utilization and may cause your device to heat up</li>
          <li>Extended use of Fast Mode may result in significant battery drain</li>

        </ul>
