# PhotoSync - Self-Hosted Photo Backup

Secure, private photo backup system. Your photos, your server, your control.

---

## Quick Start

### Option A: Local Backup (Home Wi‑Fi / LAN)

1. Download the **PhotoSync Server** app for your platform from **GitHub Releases**:
   - https://github.com/viktorvishyn369/PhotoSync/releases

2. Install it and run it.
   - It runs in your system tray / menu bar.

3. Open the tray dropdown menu, find **Local IP Addresses**, and click your IP to copy it.

4. On your phone, open the PhotoSync mobile app and go to Settings:
   - Select **Local** connection
   - Paste the IP you copied (digits only):
     - Example: `192.168.1.222`

Done. Start backing up your photos/videos.

### Option B: StealthCloud Backup

If you choose **StealthCloud**, you do not need to download/install the server app.

1. Install the PhotoSync mobile app.
2. Select **StealthCloud** inside the app.
3. Start backing up.

## Optional Install (Scripts / From Source)

If you prefer installing from source (advanced), you can use the provided scripts:

- Desktop (macOS/Linux):
  ```bash
  sudo curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viktorvishyn369/PhotoSync/main/install.sh | bash
  ```
- Windows (PowerShell as Administrator):
  ```powershell
  [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12; Invoke-RestMethod https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viktorvishyn369/PhotoSync/main/install.ps1 | Invoke-Expression
  ```
- Linux server (headless):
  ```bash
  sudo curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viktorvishyn369/PhotoSync/main/install-server.sh | bash
  ```

---

## How it works

### Local backup (LAN)

- You run **PhotoSync Server** on your computer.
- Your phone connects over your home network to the server (port `3000`).
- Photos/videos are uploaded to the server and stored on disk under your account folder.

### StealthCloud backup

- You only need the **mobile app**.
- Files are encrypted on-device and uploaded as encrypted chunks.
- The cloud stores encrypted data only.

## File Storage

Files are stored in:
```
uploads/
  └── {device-uuid}/
      ├── photo1.jpg
      ├── photo2.jpg
      └── ...
```

Each set of credentials (email + password) maps to a deterministic UUID folder, so storage is isolated per account.

## Server Management

**For Headless Linux Servers** (systemd service):
```bash
# Check status
sudo systemctl status photosync

# Stop server
sudo systemctl stop photosync

# Start server
sudo systemctl start photosync

# Restart server
sudo systemctl restart photosync

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u photosync -f
```

**For Desktop (Tray App):**
- Use the tray icon menu to Start/Stop/Restart
- Or run manually: `cd ~/PhotoSync/server && node server.js`

## Auto-Updates

PhotoSync automatically checks for updates every 24 hours.

**Check for updates manually:**
```bash
cd ~/PhotoSync/server
npm run check-update
```

**Install update:**
```bash
cd ~/PhotoSync/server
npm run update
```

The server will:
1. Create a backup of the current version
2. Download the latest version from GitHub
3. Install dependencies
4. Notify you to restart

**Update notifications:**
- Server logs show when updates are available
- Tray app shows notification (if running)
- No automatic restart - you control when to update

## Security & Privacy

### Local backup (LAN)

- Your library is stored on your own machine.
- Requests are authenticated (JWT) and stored under an account-specific folder structure.
- This mode is ideal for home networks where your phone can reach your computer directly.

### StealthCloud backup

StealthCloud is designed as an end‑to‑end encrypted backup flow:

- **On-device encryption:** your photos/videos are encrypted on your phone before upload using TweetNaCl `secretbox` (XSalsa20‑Poly1305).
- **Chunked uploads:** files are split into chunks; each chunk is encrypted independently and uploaded.
- **Encrypted manifests:** the cloud stores encrypted chunks plus an encrypted manifest (metadata needed for restore).
- **Keys stay on the device:** encryption keys are generated on the phone and stored in the OS secure storage.

This means StealthCloud stores encrypted data and is designed so that it cannot read your photos/videos.

### Remote access

Remote works like Local mode, but your server runs on a remote machine (VPS/home server) instead of your personal computer.

- Install PhotoSync Server on the remote machine (headless is recommended).
- Expose it securely over HTTPS (TLS) using a reverse proxy or tunnel (for example Cloudflare Tunnel).
- In the mobile app (Remote), enter the server host only (domain or IP). The app will use HTTPS for the connection.

## Clean Duplicates (mobile)

The **Clean Duplicates** feature finds and deletes duplicates by **content hash** (SHA-256), not by filename/date/metadata.

How it works:

- The app scans your photo/video library.
- For each readable asset, it computes a SHA-256 hash.
- Assets with the same hash are treated as duplicates.
- The app **keeps the oldest** item in each duplicate group and deletes the newer ones.

Limitations:

- In **Expo Go**, native file hashing is not available, so Clean Duplicates requires a **development build**.
- Some iOS assets may not be readable (e.g. iCloud “Optimize Storage” / `ph://` URIs), so they can be skipped.

Deletion behavior:

- **iOS**: deleted items go to **Photos → Recently Deleted**.
- **Android**: deleted items are removed from the device (behavior depends on OEM/OS).

## Requirements

### Server
- Node.js 16+ (auto-installed by scripts)
- Port 3000 available
- Linux, macOS, or Windows

### Mobile
- **Android:** 5.0+ (API 21+)
- **iOS:** 13.0+
- Network access to server

## Privacy

See [PRIVACY_POLICY.md](PRIVACY_POLICY.md)

- PhotoSync does not sell your personal data.
- Local mode stores your library on your own machine.
- StealthCloud (if enabled) stores encrypted backup data.

## Troubleshooting

### Can't connect from mobile app

**For Local Server (same WiFi network):**
1. If you are using the **Desktop Tray app**, open the tray menu and select **Local IP Addresses**, then click an address to copy it.
2. In the mobile app (Local), paste the IP address (digits only):
   - Example: `192.168.1.222`
3. If you are not using the tray app (or it shows no IP), find your server IP manually:
   - **macOS:** System Settings → Network → your connection → **IP Address**
   - **Windows:** `ipconfig` → **IPv4 Address**
   - **Linux:** Settings → Network → your connection → **IPv4** (or run `ip a`)
4. Do not use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` (this will not work from a phone).
5. Ensure the phone and computer are on the same Wi‑Fi network.

**For Remote Server (internet/VPS):**
1. Install PhotoSync Server on your remote machine (VPS/home server).
2. Put it behind HTTPS (TLS) using a reverse proxy or tunnel (for example Cloudflare Tunnel).
3. In the app (Remote), enter the host only (no `https://`, no port):
   - Example domain: `photosync.example.com`
   - Example IP: `203.0.113.10`

**Common issues:**
- Server not running? Check tray icon or terminal
- Firewall blocking? Allow port 3000
- Wrong network? Connect phone to same WiFi as server

### Port 3000 already in use
```bash
# macOS / Linux
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

### Server won't start
- Check Node.js is installed: `node --version`
- Check logs for errors
- Ensure port 3000 is available
